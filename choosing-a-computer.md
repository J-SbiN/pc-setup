# Choosing my PC
Tedious descussions, boring stories, and a way to accuratly chose a computer that suits you.
This post is targetted mostly to people with basic understanding of what a computer is. If you feel you fall short here, try a few minutes on "what is a computer".

## General Considerations
### Usage
If you already skimmed 3 posts on how to choose a computer, you wont find anything new in here - move directly to the next chapter.

When chosing a computer (laptop or desktop), the first thing you need to know is 'what do you want it to do?'.
The answer defines what hardwate specs your computer will need to satisfy your necessities. These usually fall in one of three main domains:
    
- Average Home Usage
- Harcore Processing
- Gamming

The rest of your computer features may be determined by your personal routine:

- Mobility
- Worksmanship
- Price

Keep in mind that you may opt differently for the same use case depending on weather you are working solelly with this computer you are about to acquire or you have other machines/peripherals/sattelites you may use.

A full (and tedious) discussion about the former six topics is bellow, as well as my (boring) story on how I actually decided on my machine, but what may actually help you chose a computer, either you'll be using it yourself or offering it to someone, is the specific use cases at the end of this post.

#### Average Home Usage
If all you do in your computer is browsing, blogging, run some office tools, editing memes, cutting some sound lines, cutting some videos to re-post

#### Harcore Processing
#### Gamming

#### Portability
#### Worksmanship
#### Price



### OS Considerations
There are 3 types of Operating Systems (OS) for computers: Microsoft's ones - Windows, Apple's ones and a meriade of Open Source ones - Linux, Solaris, .

### Sum Up
Ideally you've jut read all the above topics and now you are saying: "Whel!...  To be on the safe side, I want all of the above!!". So you'll find yourself in a canundrum: Market does not offer a pack including everything!!




## My Personal Case
Inicially I wanted to have a single machine for professional software development, personal software development, gamming and browsing the web. This implied that I would have to reach deep on my pockets to get a decent graphics card, a good processor, memory slots expandible to at least 32GB, a great battery (management) and decent worksmanship. My first prospects were 2-3K€ and still, worksmanship and battery autonomy were falling short.

As mentioned before, market is forked. So you do not get the best of three (four) worlds - autonomy, worksmanship, hardware (, price). 

As I move from place to place somewhat oftemly, I decided for a laptop with low autonomy - and commited to be plugged into a wall if I need to do something more than browsing the web for 1h... One day I may get rich enouth so I could buy a gamming descktop and a laptop where I can code for 10 hours - or, even better spend 6k€ on one laptop that does it all toghether - but, until then... choises!...

So I wanted to develop a webapp that I intended to be serving while being able to play somewhat demanding games... 

### Vectors for deciding on a computer
#### Laptop vs Desktop
#### Microsoft vs Apple vs Free/OpenSource
#### Pice vs Power vs Autonomy
